CASSA Code of Conduct (CASSAâ€™s COC)
==================================
This is not a comprehensive list, but instead a set of guidelines to which you should conduct yourself as an individual. Use your common sense, just because it is not on this list does not mean it does not breach the code of conduct. Additional items may be added to this list by the executive committee.
* No excessive use of foul language
* Present yourself in public professionally
* No offensive behavior
* Be respectful
This code of conduct is to be enforced at the discretion of the executive committee. Each incident shall be resolved on a case by case basis and resolution will be handed out at the discretion of the executive committee.
